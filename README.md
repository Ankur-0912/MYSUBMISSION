# MYSUBMISSION
OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT : The objective of the project is to do data pre-processing and exploratory data analysis of the dataset TASK TO DO : As a data scientist, the majority of your time will be spent on data pre-processing i.e. making sure you have the right data in the right format. Once this is done, you get a sense of your dataset through applying some descriptive statistics and then, you move on to the exploration stage wherein you plot various graphs and mine the hiddeninsights. In this project, you as a data scientist are expected to perform Exploratory data analysis on how the different features of a car and its price are related. The data comes from the Kaggle dataset "Car Features and MSRP". It describes almost 12,000 carmodels, sold in the USA between 1990 and 2017, with the market price (new or used) and some features.
